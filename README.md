## Exploring Crunchbase using SQL


**Project description**

In this project, I explored datasets from [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/), the crowdsourced platform which lists startups, investors and their people. 

The whole dataset was extracted via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase) on 17 November 2020.
It starts in 1960 and is current as of October 2013 (before Crunchbase switched to its current paid API model). It includes all the entities, their people as well as funding roundsm acquisitions and IPOs. There are 11 tables in total that can be joined using unique IDs.

 

**Objectives** 

The idea is to find out what were the characteristics that lead to the most funding and investment. 

This is a first and general analysis focused on these 3 questions:

1. What type of funding is the most frequent through time? What type of funding does raise the highest amount?
2. What kind of categories/industries attracted the highest amount of investment?
3. Where can we look for new entrepreneurs/startups?
